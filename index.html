		<p id="myP">Every day is taco ipsum tuesday. Does guac cost extra? Ooh, with diced onions and a pinch of cilantro.
			Iâ€™ve been following that taco truck around all day. TACOS!! Pico de gallo, on the side please.
			I think Iâ€™ve overdosed on tacos. Tacos for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Fish tacos: lettuce or cabbage,
			pico de gallo, avocado and a sour cream or citrus/mayonnaise sauce, all placed on top of a corn or flour tortilla.
			CARNITAS!! Iâ€™ve been following that taco truck around all day.</p>

		<p id="myp2">Tacos dorados called flautas, or taquitos, for which the tortillas are filled with pre-cooked shredded chicken,
		beef or barbacoa, rolled into an elongated cylinder and deep-fried until crisp. How bout a gosh darn quesadilla?
		TACOS!! Say taco one more time. Itâ€™s a wonderful morning for breakfast tacos. Fish tacos: lettuce or cabbage, pico
		de gallo, avocado and a sour cream or citrus/mayonnaise sauce, all placed on top of a corn or flour tortilla.
		These tacos are lit ðŸ”¥. Give me all the tacos, immediately. These tacos are lit ðŸ”¥.</p>
